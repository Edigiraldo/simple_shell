#### Requeriments
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* The C programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 

#### Compile (Install)

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```

#### Syntax
```

### How to use
shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```

```


But also in non-interactive mode:
```
$ echo "Hello World" | ./hsh
"Hello World"
```
